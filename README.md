## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## **My process**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS custom Styles
- CSS Grid layout
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Reinforce my knowledge of how images can be displayed without the use of the HTML

```html
<img />
```

but as an alternative use the CSS

```css
background-image: url(".image/file/path");
```

property-value pair.

- On this project, I did not use the concepts of Mobile-first design workflow as I had learnt in the previous challenge before this one because I was on a rush when I got on this project and was carried away, concentrating on getting the project finished too quickly that I forgot to follow a fundamental design workflow of the mobile-first design concept (I have learned from this project not to be in a rush when starting out in a new proect. One way I could have averted not implementing the mobile-first design workflow would have been to firstly have all my processes and methods alighted in a rough book of some sort.)
- Reinforced my knowledge of CSS Media queries, where I implemented the responsive feature for the mobile view layout of this project.

**Below is an excerpt of the CSS media query code/syntax I used in implementing the said responsive feature of this project:**

```css
@media (max-width: 376px) {
}
```

## **Continued development**

### ~ Plans for continued development:

I hope to in the future, focus and refine my skills in the front-end development stack and also master the concepts of responsive designs, concepts of semantics in HTML as well as accessibility and other key concepts/knowledge required in becoming a world class front-end developer!

### Useful resources

- [MDN Media queries Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand **CSS Media queries**. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
